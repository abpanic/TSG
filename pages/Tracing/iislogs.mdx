# Collecting IIS Traces for On-Premise

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for collecting traces from an on-premise deployment of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (CE) to troubleshoot issues related to the D365 CE SDK.

## Prerequisites:

- Administrative access to the D365 CE server.
- Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager installed on your machine.

## Steps:

### Enable Diagnostic Logging:

Open IIS Manager.
Expand the server node and navigate to Sites > [Your D365 CE Website].
In the Features View, double-click Trace Logging.
In the Actions pane, click Start Tracing.
Select the Trace provider as Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Trace level as Verbose.
Click OK to save the changes.

### Reproduce the Issue:

Perform the actions that consistently trigger the SDK issue you are experiencing.

### Collect the Trace File:

Open IIS Manager again.
Navigate to the same website as in step 1.
In the Features View, double-click Trace Logging.
In the Actions pane, click Stop Tracing.
Click View All Traces....
Locate the trace file named similar to D365-<Date>-<Time>.etl and download it.
Package and Share the Trace File:

Compress the downloaded trace file using a tool like ZIP or RAR.
Important: Due to the potentially large size of the trace file, avoid attaching it directly to emails.
Instead, upload the compressed file to a cloud storage service like OneDrive or SharePoint and share the access link with the support team.
Additional Notes:

Collecting traces can impact system performance. Stop tracing as soon as you have reproduced the issue and collected the necessary data.
If the trace file size is exceptionally large, consider collecting only a specific timeframe around the issue occurrence using the Start Time and End Time options in the Trace Logging window.
Sharing sensitive information within the trace file is highly discouraged. Ensure you are comfortable sharing the collected data before proceeding.
By following these steps, you can effectively capture valuable diagnostic information to assist the D365 CE SDK support team in resolving your issue efficiently.
