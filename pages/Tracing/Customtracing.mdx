# Integrating Logging into Custom Applications for Dynamics 365 CE

Implementing effective logging mechanisms is pivotal for monitoring application health, facilitating debugging, and ensuring operational transparency. This guide outlines a strategy to incorporate logging into custom applications that interact with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (D365 CE), focusing on the use of `ILogger`, a part of the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` namespace.

## Choosing a Logging Approach

While various third-party logging frameworks like Serilog and log4net offer rich features, this guide emphasizes the use of `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. This approach provides a standard, extensible logging API that supports various logging providers and is seamlessly integrated into .NET Core and .NET 5/6 applications.

## Utilizing `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`

`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` abstracts logging into an extensible system, which can route logs to multiple destinations. It is designed to be lightweight and supports structured logging, log filtering by level, and more.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Project Setup

1. **Create Your Project**: Start by setting up a C# project suitable for your application's needs, such as a console, web, or worker service project.

2. **Add Required Packages**: Ensure your project references `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. For projects targeting .NET Core 3.1 or later, this package is usually included by default.

### Step 2: Configure Logging

In a .NET Core or .NET 5/6 application, logging is typically configured in the `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` file, depending on the application type. Here's an example for a console application:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
        {
            builder
                .AddConsole()
                .AddDebug()
                .SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Information);
        });

        ILogger logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();
        logger.LogInformation("Application Starting");

        // Place your Dynamics 365 CE integration logic here

        logger.LogInformation("Application Ending");
    }
}
```

In this configuration:

- **LoggerFactory**: Creates an instance of `ILoggerFactory` that is used to configure and instantiate loggers.
- **AddConsole** and **AddDebug**: Adds console and debug log providers. You can add other providers as needed.
- **SetMinimumLevel**: Defines the global minimum log level. Logs below this level are not logged.

### Step 3: Logging in Your Application

With `ILogger` configured, you can inject it into your classes (in ASP.NET Core applications via Dependency Injection) or create instances directly using the factory, as shown in the example. Use it to log messages of different severities throughout your application:

```csharp
logger.LogTrace("Detailed trace message");
logger.LogDebug("Debugging information");
logger.LogInformation("General information message");
logger.LogWarning("A warning message");
logger.LogError("An error message");
logger.LogCritical("A critical error message");
```

### Best Practices

- **Use Log Levels Appropriately**: Utilize different log levels to categorize the importance and type of logged information.
- **Structured Logging**: Take advantage of structured logging to enrich log messages with additional context.
- **Centralized Logging**: For larger applications, consider using a centralized logging platform to aggregate logs from multiple sources.
- **Sensitive Information**: Be cautious not to log sensitive information such as passwords or personal data.

## Conclusion

By integrating `ILogger` into your Dynamics 365 CE custom applications, you gain a flexible and powerful logging mechanism that enhances the maintainability and debuggability of your applications. This approach leverages the built-in features of the .NET platform, allowing for a standardized logging practice across your projects.
