# Customization.xml in Dynamics 365 CE: A Guide

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to access, open, and edit the `customization.xml` file within a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (D365 CE) solution.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Dynamics 365 CE environment.
- Appropriate security roles and permissions to access solutions and modify customizations (e.g., System Administrator or System Customizer role).
- Familiarity with XML structure and syntax for those who will be editing `customization.xml` directly.

## Accessing and Exporting the Solution

To edit the `customization.xml` file, you first need to export the solution from Dynamics 365 CE.

1. **Navigate to Solutions**: In your Dynamics 365 CE instance, go to the `Settings` area, and under `Customizations`, select `Solutions`.

2. **Open Solution**: Find the solution you want to edit, and click to open it.

3. **Export Solution**: On the solution's toolbar, select `Export`. Follow the export wizard steps, ensuring you choose to export the solution as "Unmanaged" for editing purposes.

4. **Download Solution**: After the export process completes, download the solution ZIP file to your local machine.

## Extracting and Editing Customization.xml

The exported solution ZIP file contains the `customization.xml` along with other components of the solution.

1. **Extract ZIP File**: Use a file extraction tool to extract the contents of the downloaded solution ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.

2. **Locate Customization.xml**: In the extracted files, find the `customization.xml` file. This file contains the solution's metadata and configurations.

3. **Edit Customization.xml**:
   - **Using a Text Editor**: Open `customization.xml` in a text editor or an IDE (like Visual Studio Code) that supports XML. Make the necessary changes to the XML content.
   - **Using an XML Editor**: For a more guided experience, use an XML editor that can validate XML structure and syntax, providing a more error-proof editing environment.

## Common Customizations

- **Entities**: Add, modify, or remove custom entities and their properties.
- **Fields**: Add new fields to entities, modify existing field properties, or remove fields.
- **Relationships**: Define or modify relationships between entities.
- **Forms and Views**: Customize entity forms and views by adding or rearranging components.

## Best Practices for Editing

- **Backup**: Always keep a backup of the original `customization.xml` before making changes.
- **Validate XML**: Ensure the edited XML is well-formed and valid. Use XML validation tools to check for errors.
- **Incremental Changes**: Make and test changes incrementally to isolate and troubleshoot issues more effectively.
- **Commenting**: Use XML comments to document significant changes or customizations for future reference.

## Importing the Modified Solution

After editing and saving your changes to `customization.xml`, you need to import the solution back into Dynamics 365 CE.

1. **Repackage Solution**: Compress the edited files back into a ZIP file, maintaining the original structure.

2. **Navigate to Solutions**: In Dynamics 365 CE, go to `Settings` > `Customizations` > `Solutions`.

3. **Import Solution**: Select `Import` from the toolbar, and upload the modified solution ZIP file. Follow the import wizard steps to complete the process.

4. **Publish Customizations**: After the import, it's crucial to publish all customizations for the changes to take effect.

## Troubleshooting

- **Import Errors**: If import errors occur, review the error details provided by Dynamics 365 CE. Most errors provide specific information on what went wrong.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the solution in a non-production environment before applying changes to production.

## Conclusion

Editing the `customization.xml` in a Dynamics 365 CE solution allows for deep customization of the system. However, it requires careful handling to ensure system integrity and functionality. Always follow best practices for editing, backup, and testing to ensure a successful customization process.
