# Information Gathering Guide
**Purpose**: This guide is designed to assist in gathering the necessary information to effectively debug.

## Information Required:

**1. Problem Description:**

* Briefly describe the issue the user is experiencing.
* Include the specific functionality or feature affected.
* If there is an error message, obtain the exact wording of error messages displayed.

**2. System Information:**

* Operating System (Windows, macOS, etc. if issue is device specific)
* Device model and specifications (if issue is on mobile app only or on specific machine)
* App version
* SDK version

**3. Reproducibility:**

* Can the issue be consistently reproduced?
* If yes, describe the steps the user takes to reproduce the issue.
* If no, what are the scenarios or times frames for the issue to reproduce
* Gather a problem steps recorder with steps [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/record-steps-to-reproduce-a-problem-46582a9b-620f-2e36-00c9-04e25d784e47#:~:text=To%20open%20Steps%20Recorder%2C%20select,you're%20trying%20to%20diagnose "problem steps recorder") demonstrating the issue.
* Alternately , powerpoint can be used to capture video.

**4. Network Connectivity:**

* Is the user connected to the internet when the issue occurs?
* If yes, what is the network type (Wi-Fi, cellular data, etc.)?

**5. Error Logs:**

* If available, request the user to share any relevant error logs from the app or system console.
* Specify the location or method for accessing the logs.

**6. Network Traffic:**

* If applicable, request the user to capture network traffic using a tool like Fiddler while reproducing the issue.
* This can help identify any network-related errors or communication issues with the SDK.

**7. Additional Information:**

**Gather any other relevant details that may help diagnose the issue, such as:**
* Recent changes made to the app or system
* Any custom configurations or integrations
* Steps the user has already taken to troubleshoot the issue

**Tips for Effective Information Gathering:**

- Maintain a professional and courteous tone throughout the conversation.
- Explain the purpose of collecting information and how it will help resolve the issue.
- Ask clear and concise questions, avoiding technical jargon if possible.
- Provide step-by-step instructions on capturing screenshots, recordings, or logs.
- Express appreciation for the user's time and cooperation.
