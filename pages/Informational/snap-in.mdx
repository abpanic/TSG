# What is a Dynamics CRM snap-in?

A Dynamics CRM snap-in is a software module designed to extend the functionality of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM platform (now part of Dynamics 365). Here's a breakdown:

* **Extension Modules:** Snap-ins are like plugins or add-ons that provide additional tools or features within the Dynamics CRM environment.  

* **Customization:** They enable developers to customize Dynamics CRM behavior, integrate with third-party systems, or create specialized workflows tailored to specific business processes.

* **.NET Framework:**  Dynamics CRM snap-ins were primarily built using the .NET Framework, leveraging programming languages like C#.

* **Legacy Technology:** Snap-ins have largely been replaced by more modern web-based customization approaches within Dynamics 365. However, they might still be relevant for some on-premises Dynamics CRM deployments.

**Examples of Snap-in Use Cases:** 

* **Data Integration:** Snap-ins can connect Dynamics CRM with external databases or applications.

* **Workflow Automation:** Creating custom business logic and automated processes within the CRM system.

* **Specialized UI Elements:** Adding new buttons, forms, or dashboards to Dynamics CRM for specific needs.
